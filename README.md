# Hand-gesture-3d-visualization
This project is an interactive real-time 3D visualization where hand gestures control thousands of glowing particles. Using MediaPipe Hands for AI-based hand tracking and Three.js for 3D rendering, particles dynamically morph into different shapes based on finger gestures.  This project demonstrates skills in:  Computer Vision  WebGL &amp; 3D Graphics.
